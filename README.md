# set a callback for an inline_keyboard in a Telegram bot API using PHP

To set a callback for an inline_keyboard in a Telegram bot API using PHP, you will need to create a button that has a callback_data property assigned to it.

Here is an example of how you can create an inline_keyboard with a button that has a callback_data property:

```
<?php
$inline_keyboard = [
    [
        [
            'text' => 'Click me',
            'callback_data' => 'button_clicked'
        ]
    ]
];
```

In this example, the inline_keyboard variable is an array that contains a single row with a single button. The button has two properties: text and callback_data. The text property determines the text that will be displayed on the button, while the callback_data property specifies the data that will be sent back to the bot when the button is clicked.

To handle the callback data when the button is clicked, you will need to listen for updates from the Telegram API and parse the callback_query object that is included in the update. Here's an example of how you can handle the callback data:

```
<?php
$update = json_decode(file_get_contents('php://input'), true);

if (isset($update['callback_query'])) {
    $callback_query = $update['callback_query'];
    $callback_data = $callback_query['data'];
    $chat_id = $callback_query['message']['chat']['id'];
    $message_id = $callback_query['message']['message_id'];
    
    // Handle the callback data here...
}
```
In this example, the $update variable is populated with the update data from the Telegram API. We then check if the update contains a callback_query object, which indicates that a button has been clicked. We extract the callback_data, chat_id, and message_id from the update data, which we can then use to handle the callback data in whatever way we need to.
